People have been watching the North Star for centuries, and even navigators and travelers have depended on it to guide them. Since it is the perfect combination of magic and mystery, it has gained various interpretations and meanings over time. If you are in the northern hemisphere, you can figure out your direction by finding the North Star. For thousands of years, it has been a handy survival tool for navigators and travelers, even in the dark of night. In fact, it is more accurate than a compass in providing direction and helping people stay on course. Today, knowing how to find the North Star remains one of the most basic survival skills.

Ancient navigators observed that all the stars in the sky seem to circle around the North Star, which was known to the ancient Greeks as Kynosoura, meaning "dog's tail." By the 17th century, the North Star was used figuratively for anything that is the focus of attention. Due to this, the North Star also became associated with life's purpose, the heart's true desires, and unchangeable ideals to follow in your life. Just like the literal North Star, it gives you direction in life. As we look within ourselves, we can discover and develop the gifts that we already have to help us achieve our full potential
